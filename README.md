# Fertilizer Recommendation and Disease Classification

 ### Problem Statement:
 Agriculture is the most important sector in todayâ€™s life. Most plants are affected by a wide
 variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. Diseases on plants placed a major constraint on
 the production and a major threat to food security. Hence, early and accurate
 identification of plant diseases is essential to ensure high quantity and best quality. In
 recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused has
 increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, changes in cultivation methods, and
 inadequate plant protection techniques.
 An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on plants by checking
 the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant. CNN model techniques are used to
 identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can be taken for those diseases.
